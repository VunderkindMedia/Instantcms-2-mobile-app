### üõ† Breaking changes

### üéâ New features

### üêõ Bug fixes

## 0.3.3 ‚Äî 2020-06-24

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed total incompatibility with the web platform ‚Äì calling unsupported methods will now throw a readable `UnavailabilityError`. ([#8853](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8853) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

## 0.3.2 ‚Äî 2020-06-10

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed compatibility with `expo-permissions` below `9.0.0` (the _duplicate symbols_ problem). ([#8753](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8753) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

## 0.3.1 ‚Äî 2020-06-03

### üéâ New features

- Added support for including foreign (non-`expo-notifications`-created) notifications in `getPresentedNotificationsAsync` on Android. ([#8614](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8614) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed `getExpoPushTokenAsync` rejecting when `getDevicePushTokenAsync`'s `Promise` hasn't fulfilled yet (and vice versa). Probably also added support for calling these methods reliably with Fast Refresh enabled. ([#8608](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8608) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

## 0.3.0 ‚Äî 2020-05-28

### üéâ New features

- Added native permission requester that will let developers call `Permissions.getAsync(Permissions.NOTIFICATIONS)` (or `askAsync`) when this module is installed. ([#8486](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8486) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
> Note that the effect of this method is the same as if you called `Notifications.getPermissionsAsync()` (or `requestPermissionsAsync`) and then `Notifications.getDevicePushTokenAsync()`‚Äîit tries to both ask the user for user-facing notifications permissions and then tries to register the device for remote notifications. We are planning to deprecate the `.NOTIFICATIONS` permission soon.

## 0.2.0 ‚Äî 2020-05-27

### üõ† Breaking changes

- > Note that this may or may not be a breaking change for you ‚Äî if you'd expect the notification to be automatically dismissed when tapped on this is a bug fix and a new feature (fixes inconsistency between platforms as on iOS this is the only supported behavior; adds the ability to customize the behavior on Android). If you'd expect the notification to only be dismissed at your will this is a breaking change and you'll need to add `autoDismiss: false` to your notification content inputs.
Changed the default notification behavior on Android to be automatically dismissed when clicked. This is customizable with the `autoDismiss` parameter of `NotificationContentInput`. ([#8241](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8241) by [@thorbenprimke](https://github.com/thorbenprimke))

### üéâ New features

- Added the ability to configure whether the notification should be automatically dismissed when tapped on or not (on Android) with the `autoDismiss` parameter of `NotificationContentInput`. ([#8241](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8241) by [@thorbenprimke](https://github.com/thorbenprimke))
- Added `DailyTriggerInput` that allows scheduling a daily recurring notification for a specific hour and minute. It is supported on both iOS and Android. ([#8199](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8199) by [@thorbenprimke](https://github.com/thorbenprimke))

- Added a macro check for `UNLocationNotificationTrigger` to make this module compatible with Mac Catalyst ([#8171](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8171) by [@robertying](https://github.com/robertying))
- Fixed notification content text being truncated without the ability to expand the notification by adding [`BigTextStyle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.BigTextStyle) to all Android notifications, which allows them to be expanded and their content text fully viewed ([#8140](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8140) by [@thorbenprimke](https://github.com/thorbenprimke))
- Added a check for trigger input that throws an error if user misuses the `seconds` property ([#8261](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8261) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))
